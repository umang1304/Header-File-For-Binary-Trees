# Header File For Binary Trees
Since, there is no inbuilt header file available in STL of C++ for Binary Tress data structure, so, we can include this header file in our code for performing some common operations on binary trees. Including this header file in our code will reduce the number of lines of our code and it will also save our time, which we were supposed to give for creating the binarytreenode class and input function for taking the input.
We can include this file by writing- #include "binary_tree.h" at the top of our code.
